This is a multi-project solution.
All projects are in 1 solution: PGE.
The reason why the whole solution is called PGE is that the main project here is PGE and the other
projects are side projects needed to be created for PGE during development. They are different projects
so can be built separately but dependencies should be considered.
Example: if someone wants to build CConsole, it has to get PFL.lib prior to building.

Project dependency tree:
  - PFL (.lib)
    - CConsole (.lib)
      - PGE (.lib)
        - ELTE-FAIL (.exe)
        - UnitTests (.exe)

Build order is from top left to bottom right.
So CConsole depends on PFL, PGE depends on CConsole and PFL, etc.
ELTE-FAIL and UnitTests can be built in parallel since they have the same dependencies.


We have the following repos:
- rPFL
- rConsole
- rPGE
- rELTE-FAIL
- rUnitTests
- rVS2012-PGE-sln (for solution and other textfiles like this txt)

So as seen above, every project has its own repository.

1) PRREallHeaders.h and PGEallHeaders.h should be included in EVERY SINGLE PRRE header file

2) PRREallHeaders.h and PGEallHeaders.h MUSTN'T include anything

3) PRREpragmas.h and PGEpragmas.h MUSTN'T be included in any header files.
   They should be included in cpp files only.

4) We have EXTERNAL and INTERNAL header files.
   EXTERNAL headers are public, meaning that they will be delivered
	to API-users as well, so they should contain as minimal info about internals as they can.
   INTERNAL headers are private headers, used for compiling the library, etc. They MUSTN'T be included in EXTERNAL headers.

5) PGEconsts.h and PRREconsts.h are INTERNAL headers thus MUSTN'T be included in EXTERNAL headers.

I) adding support for a new TC (texture compression) in PRRE
	1. - new enum(s) should be added to both TPRRE_TEX_COMPRESSION_MODE and TPRRE_TEX_FORMAT
	2. - texture format enum(s) should be handled in both PRRETexture::DescribeTexFormatAndSize() and PRRETexture::getTargetInternalFormat()
	3. - PRREhwVideo::DiscoverTextureCompressionAvailability() should be also updated with checking for the new TC
	4. - creating textures in unit tests with the new TC is not neccessarily needed but testGetInternalFormat() should handle them when PRRE_TC_AUTO is used:
		 tex128x128x24_cmpAUTO and tex128x128x32_cmpAUTO cases.
		 testGetUsedTextureMemory() should be also updated when the compression ratio is different than the already checked ratios (1:4, 1:8) for the cmpAUTO cases
		 mentioned above.
	5. - update relevant comments regarding to the TC. For example, if borders are supported by the TC or not: PRRETextureManager::SetDefaultCompressionMode().
