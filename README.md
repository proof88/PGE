# PGE
PR00F's Game Engine

This game engine is being developed to make my games with it.

**v0.3 Requires:**
 - [PFL v1.1](https://github.com/proof88/PFL);
 - [CConsole v1.1](https://github.com/proof88/Console).

This game engine contains the PURE graphics engine that has its own documentation:  
https://proof88.github.io/pure-doc/

**Project kanban board** for PURE 0.4 is here: https://github.com/users/proof88/projects/5 <br/>
Future versions will have project kanban board under this repo.

The Visual Studio project file is included.<br/>
However, if you want to see example of integration in other projects, you may be interested in the Visual Studio solution including other projects as well in [PGE-misc](https://github.com/proof88/PGE-misc) repo.
