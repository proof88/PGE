# PGE
PR00F's Game Engine

This game engine is being developed to make my games with it.

**Requires:**
 - [PFL v1.0](https://github.com/proof88/PFL);
 - [CConsole v1.0](https://github.com/proof88/Console).

This game engine contains the PURE graphics engine that has its own documentation: https://proof88.github.io/pure-doc/

The Visual Studio project file is included.<br/>
However, if you want to see example of integration in other projects, you may be interested in the Visual Studio solution including other projects as well in [PGE-misc](https://github.com/proof88/PGE-misc) repo.
