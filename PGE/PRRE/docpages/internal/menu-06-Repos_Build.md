\page repos_and_build Repositories And Build

Information about the source code repositories and how to build projects can be found in the [PGE-misc repository](https://github.com/proof88/PGE-misc).  

There are a few useful TXT files:
 - [CodingConventions-PR00F.txt](https://github.com/proof88/PGE-misc/blob/master/src/CodingConventions-PR00F.txt) - coding conventions I stick to in my projects;
 - [PGE-WoW.txt](https://github.com/proof88/PGE-misc/blob/master/src/PGE-WoW.txt) - describes the repositories and projects, and how to build them, including how to generate this doc;
 - [ProjectSettings-PR00F.txt](https://github.com/proof88/PGE-misc/blob/master/src/ProjectSettings-PR00F.txt) - Compiler and Linker settings for Release and Debug mode builds.
