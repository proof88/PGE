\section gui_intro Intro

I have found the following web page that has a comprehensive list of GUI libraries for C++:
https://philippegroarke.com/posts/2018/c++_ui_solutions/

From the list, I revised the following 4 libraries that are suitable for OpenGL and have hardly any dependencies:
 - GiGi: http://gigi.sourceforge.net/index.php
 - Turbo Badger: https://github.com/fruxo/turbobadger
 - Nuklear: https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear
 - Dear ImGui: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui

The first 2 are not maintaned anymore, the third is pure C, so I have opted for the last one: Dear ImGui.

\section gui_usage Usage

TODO ...
maybe the usage should be elaborated in the Usage main section?
