# Variables can have a one-liner short explanation comment right above them.
# This is NOT such a one-liner since this is not right above the next variable.

# However, this is a one-liner short explanation.
cap_max = 999
# Variables can also have a longer, even multi-line more detailed explanation below them.
# This explanation lasts until the next non-comment line.

testVar = Values can have spaces, since they last until end of line!

testVar2=Values can have spaces, since they last until end of line!

# Setting a var to empty string is easy, just write nothing after '=':
testVar3=

# You can also place space chars, they will be preserved:
testVar4=   

# However, values having non-space chars as well, are left-trimmed:
testVar5 =     alma    
# So this variable will have "alma    " stored.
# I might change this behavior, but currently I leave it as it is.
