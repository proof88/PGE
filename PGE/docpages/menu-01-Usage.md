\page usage Engine Usage

[TOC]

Main class of the engine is PGE. Initialization, shutdown, and access to other engine classes are done through this main class.

This page gives you a brief hint on the usage, but you can always check the UnitTests as well for different cases.  

\section initialization Initialization

TODO.

\section shutdown Shutdown

Graceful termination of the client application can be a reason for shutting down the game engine.  

TODO  

Note that an uninitialized engine cannot be shut down. First you need to initialize the engine to shut it down.  
I know this sounds weird, but [sometimes it is not straightforward](https://i.imgur.com/CWfyFbB.jpg). :)
