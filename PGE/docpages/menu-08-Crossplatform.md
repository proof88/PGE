\page crossplatform Cross Platform

PGE does not yet build for Linux due to using Windows-specific headers such as conio.h and windows.h.  
The work required to be cross platform is [tracked here](https://github.com/proof88/PRooFPS-dd/milestone/7).  
The CMake files have been generated from the vcxproj and sln files [as described here](https://github.com/proof88/PRooFPS-dd/issues/9).
