**Important:** you are reading a markdown file that can be rendered by github, but this and other markdown files are the input for the [official doxygen-generated documentation of PGE](https://proof88.github.io/pge-doc/).

# Introduction

This documentation describes how [my engine](https://github.com/proof88/PGE/) works and explains relevant technologies.  

## Motivation

## Copy & Paste
I am not marking copy-pasted sentences or paragraphs one-by-one with citation marks, but at the same time I am NOT declaring the content of this documentation to be 100% my own intellectual product.

## Sources
This documentation contains intellectual properties of various sources, listed below:
